# User Verification API for Operators

Purpose: Ensure a player’s identity is verified before allowing any betting activity.

Steps:
1. Open the User Profile in the operator dashboard.
2. Check the Verification Status field:
  - ✅ Verified — user can place bets and make deposits.
  - ⏳ Pending — verification link sent; user must complete the process.
  - ❌ Unverified — user must verify before continuing.  
3. If unverified, click “Resend Verification Link” to send a new email/SMS.
4. Once verified, the system automatically enables betting for that account.

Tip:  
If the user reports issues, confirm their email/phone number is correct and advise them to check spam or SMS filters.
